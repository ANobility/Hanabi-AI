This project builds an AI that can play the Japanese board game Hanabi,
The project code is mainly composed of the following three parts

1: HanabiClasses.py, which includes several classes and related methods necessary for the basic architecture of the game.

2: AI.py, which includes algorithms related to AI, which can give optimal actions based on the current state of the game.

3:Hanabi.py, the entry to the program, is used to integrate the first two files and run using CLI so that the AI can cooperate with the player to complete the game.

Hanabi can be played on the CLI by running main function in Hanabi class. 
The game has two modes: AI and player cooperation & player and player cooperation.

The AI player's calculation time, action and total score of each step in each game are recorded in a file called 'AI step.txt', which can be used to replay the AI's performance in a game.

This game is based on Python3.9 development, please pay attention to the relevant dependencies before running.
